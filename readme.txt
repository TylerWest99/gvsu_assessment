Hello this is a automated gvsu self assessment program. It will answer the survey the same as when you last took it except for it may change the
box about if you are going into campus or not that day depending on which script you use.

Setup
To start download nodejs from online and also download the selenium webdriver both are required.

Once they are both installed on your computer you can make an executable script (bash for Mac) (Bat for Windows) that will move into that 
directory and launch the script. If you are on Mac os make sure to make the file executable using Chmod to allow the script to run.

The scripts default to requiring you to input your GV password and GV username but you can edit the scripts to use your password and username.
To do this open one or both of the files and change the GV password and GV username variables and place your specific credientials in between
the "" for bot. 

Then if you are on Windows you can use windows automated sheduler to schedule the Bat file to run whenever you want it to.
